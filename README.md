in order to pass the level. In the prefab folder you have the player with all the
animations and the enemy prefabs that you can put anywhere on the scene 
to make as many levels as you want. All the prefabs are game ready with 
animations, colliders and triggers. There is also a health bat attach to the player
that cand be recharged by collectables you find on the level. After you collect 
all the diamonds in the level the door at the end will open and if you pass it 
the game will be restarted
